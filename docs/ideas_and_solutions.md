**Solution:**
Integrate an AI Learning Companion directly into Moodle that provides:

- Smart search and summaries of lessons and uploaded files
- Answers to general questions and questions about school

**Expected impact:**
Students stay focused on clear objectives, spend less time searching for relevant materials.

**Evaluation criteria:**

- [ ] Time saved per student when searching for learning materials (target: 30% reduction)
- [ ] Student satisfaction with AI-generated summaries (target: >75% positive feedback)
- [ ] Accuracy of answers to school-related questions (target: >85% correct responses)
- [ ] User adoption rate after 4 weeks (target: >60% of students use it regularly)

### 2. Adaptive AI Tutor for Differentiated Learning

**Problem addressed:**
Unequal learning results â€” strong students advance quickly, weaker ones fall behind.

**Solution:**
Implement an AI Support system to help with different problems:

- The AI explains assignments in simple language
- AI can help explain tasks in more detail to prevent asking teachers repeatedly
- Support multilingual explanations for non-native speakers

**Expected impact:**
More balanced learning outcomes, reduced frustration for struggling students.

**Evaluation criteria:**

- [ ] Improvement in test scores for struggling students (target: +15% average)
- [ ] Reduction in achievement gap between strong and weak students (target: 20% narrower)
- [ ] Student confidence increase (measured via survey, target: >70% feel more confident)
- [ ] Number of repetitive teacher questions reduced (target: 40% decrease)
- [ ] Multilingual support usage rate (track language preferences)

### 3. AI Support Center for Teachers

**Problem addressed:**
Teachers spend too much time repeating explanations and answering the same questions.

**Solution:**
Add an AI Teacher Assistant module that:

- Automatically answers frequently asked questions from students
- Assists in explaining learning fields if someone has not understood the goal

**Expected impact:**
Teachers save time on routine explanations and can focus on individual student feedback and creative teaching.

**Evaluation criteria:**

- [ ] Teacher time saved per week (target: 3-5 hours)
- [ ] Percentage of student questions answered by AI vs. teacher (target: >50% by AI)
- [ ] Teacher satisfaction with AI assistant (target: >80% positive feedback)
- [ ] Quality of AI explanations rated by teachers (target: >75% "good" or "excellent")
- [ ] Increase in time spent on creative teaching activities (measured via teacher logs)
